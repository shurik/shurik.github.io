I'm a web developer, artist and photographer living in San Francisco, CA.

I grew up in Tiraspol, Transnistria. At the time, it was part of Moldova, a republic in the Soviet Union. A small city of about 100,000 people just north of the Black Sea, it was a place rich with history dating back to Ancient Greece and Rome. It is now the capital of an unrecognized, independent state. While I was growing up I attended the city art school and continued to study art after immigrating to US. I completed UCLA’s Art program and recieved a B.A., with honors, in Fine Art with a Russian Literature minor. After graduating college, I worked at several art galleries in Los Angeles and New York, but eventually found my way to doing web development and have since worked on many sites of various complexity. Prior to joining Butchershop, I worked as a web developer at UC Berkeley’s College of Engineering. In my time off, I try to catch up on reading The New Yorker and eat, drink and dance around San Francisco.
