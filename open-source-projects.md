I maintain a couple of open source projects on GitHub.

## [Mezzanine Instagram](https://github.com/shurik/mezzanine_instagram)

This is a small Python web application that integrates the popular [Django](djangoproject.com) based [Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.jupo.org/) CMS with [Instagram](http://instagram.com/). Currently it supports displaying a single user's stream of photos as well as curating tag based streams.
