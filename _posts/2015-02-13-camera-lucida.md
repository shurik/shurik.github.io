There's a lot to be said for drawing from life. It's a sort of an un-mediated experience when an artist looks at her subject and using very simple tools records what she sees. With a little bit of talent and a lot of practice one can get pretty good at rendering very realistic images. With a bit of imagination the sky is the limit and the drawings can become very fanciful. But our day to day life is anything but *un-mediated*.

Sometime around 2001 I read a book by an artist that I had encountered in college, [Secret Knowledge by David Hockney](http://www.thamesandhudson.com/Secret_Knowledge/9780500286388). It had put forth a theory that artists during the Renaissance had used optical devices to aid their process.

One of these devices a [Camera Lucida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_lucida) allows an artist to see the drawing surface and the subject at the same time.

These days it is rare to come across purely optical devices like that but almost everyone carries around around a smart phone, often with more than one camera capable of still and video recording. I realized that it would be pretty simple to create a mobile application that overlaid a static image over the video feed from the device so it would be possible to suspend it over the drawing surface and trace the image. In fact several of these apps are in the Apple App Store, and one is even priced at a hefty $4.99.

I'm always on the look out for an interesting project to hack on and after a bit of googling and a couple of great on-line tutorials I'd put together a Camera Lucida app of my own. Here are a couple of results.
